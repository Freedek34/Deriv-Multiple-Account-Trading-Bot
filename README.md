Deriv Multiple Account Trading Bot
Backstory: Scaling Our Trading Operations
As the founder of a budding trading firm, my journey has been about constant innovation and growth. A key challenge we faced was efficiently managing and scaling our trading activities across multiple client accounts on Deriv.com. Manual execution was simply not sustainable, and we needed a robust solution to expand our Assets Under Management (AUM) and streamline operations for our team and clients.

That's where the idea for this Deriv Multiple Account Trading Bot was born. It's a tool I developed to automate our trading strategies, allowing us to apply consistent logic or tailored approaches across various accounts simultaneously. This bot is a direct result of our efforts to professionalize and expand our trading capabilities, and I believe it can offer similar benefits to other traders and firms looking to optimize their Deriv.com operations.

Description
This repository contains a Python-based trading bot meticulously designed to manage and execute trades across multiple Deriv.com accounts concurrently, specifically tailored for Deriv Volatility Indices. It automates trading strategies, enabling users to apply the same logic or different strategies across various accounts without manual intervention. This bot is ideal for traders who manage a portfolio of Deriv accounts and seek to significantly streamline their trading operations on volatility markets.

Features
Multi-Account Support: Seamlessly connect and manage trades on multiple Deriv.com accounts concurrently.

Automated Trading: Execute predefined trading strategies automatically, ensuring consistent application of your market views on Volatility Indices.

Customizable Strategies: Easily integrate and customize your own trading logic for volatility markets.

Robust Risk Management: Implement essential stop-loss and take-profit levels for each trade, helping to protect your capital.

Real-time Monitoring: (Potentially, if implemented) Keep track of trade status and account performance.

User-Friendly Configuration: Simple setup for API tokens and account details.

Installation
To get started with the Deriv Multiple Account Trading Bot, follow these simple steps:

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Freedek34/Deriv-Multiple-Account-Trading-Bot.git
cd Deriv-Multiple-Account-Trading-Bot
Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Bash

python -m venv venv
On Windows:

Bash

venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installing dependencies, the core setup involves inputting your API tokens:

Input Your API Tokens:
When you run the bot, you will be prompted to enter your primary Deriv.com API token. For any subsidiary accounts you wish to manage, you will also be prompted to input their API tokens, separated by commas.

Example interaction (console):

Enter your primary Deriv API Token: YOUR_MAIN_API_TOKEN_HERE
Enter API Tokens for subsidiary accounts (comma-separated, e.g., 'TOKEN1','TOKEN2'): 'SUB_TOKEN_1','SUB_TOKEN_2','SUB_TOKEN_3'
Note: The bot's internal logic will then handle how these tokens are used to connect and manage trading for Deriv Volatility Indices.

Run the Bot:
Once you've provided the necessary API tokens, the bot will initialize and begin its operations based on its programmed strategy for volatility indices.

Bash

python main.py
